# TF Flowers Classification Notebook

This notebook demonstrates the process of building a flower classification model using TensorFlow and the TF Flowers dataset. The model is based on the Xception architecture, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that is fine-tuned for the specific task of flower classification.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Datasets (tfds)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install these dependencies using the following:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets matplotlib
```

## Notebook Overview
1. **Loading the Dataset**: The TF Flowers dataset is loaded using TensorFlow Datasets (`tfds`). The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and preprocessed using the Xception preprocessing function.

3. **Building the Model**: The Xception model is used as a base, and a custom output layer is added for flower classification. The model is compiled with a sparse categorical crossentropy loss and SGD optimizer.

4. **Training the Model**: The model is trained on the training set for 5 epochs, and validation accuracy is monitored.

5. **Fine-tuning**: The top layers of the Xception model are unfrozen, and the model is fine-tuned for an additional 5 epochs.

## Usage
1. Run each cell sequentially in the notebook.
2. Make sure to have an internet connection during the first run to download the TF Flowers dataset.

## Notes
- The notebook uses a subset of the training set for quick experimentation. Adjust the split ratios for a larger dataset.
- Fine-tuning is optional and can be modified based on the specific requirements.

Feel free to explore and modify the notebook for your own classification tasks!
